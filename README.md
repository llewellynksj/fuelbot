## User Experience (UX)
### **Purpose**

Aimed at people who want to better understand how much they are spending on their vehicles so they can be better informed when making financial decisions. 

FuelBot allows the user to log details for up to 3 vehicles. They can regularly track their fuel spend and any additional costs on general vehicle expenses.
Once they have entered a minimum of 3 entries this handy programme will be able to offer insights about their average spend per month/week/day as well as average cost per litre and mpg.
