## User Experience (UX)
### **Purpose**

Aimed at people who want to better understand how much they are spending on their vehicles so they can be better informed when making financial decisions. 

FuelBot allows the user to log details for up to 3 vehicles. They can regularly track their fuel spend and any additional costs on general vehicle expenses.
Once they have entered a minimum of 3 entries this handy programme will be able to offer insights about their average spend per month/week/day as well as average cost per litre and mpg.

<br>

### User Stories

## Design
### **Colour Scheme**
Coloured fonts were used to make the programme more visually appealing. The primary colour was used for core text, while the secondary colour was used mostly to inidicate a system message to the user.

Primary colour: Light cyan

Secondary colour: Yellow

<br>

### **Typography**
For each core screen the heading is presented in a chunky font. This has been created using [pyfiglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/0.7/) font "slant".
The font has a motorsport feel to it and so is in keeping with a tool based around vehicle performance.


<br>

### **Programme Model**

The below [Lucid](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) flowchart was created when thinking about the structure of this programme. A clear vision of the process helped to design a core model.
