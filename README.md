## User Experience (UX)
### **Purpose**

Aimed at people who want to better understand how much they are spending on their vehicles so they can be better informed when making financial decisions. 

FuelBot allows the user to log details for up to 3 vehicles. They can regularly track their fuel spend and any additional costs on general vehicle expenses.
Once they have entered a minimum of 3 entries this handy programme will be able to offer insights about their average spend per month/week/day as well as average cost per litre and mpg.

<br>

### User Stories

Users:
 - People wanting to cut their spending down and save
 - Motor enthusiasts who like to track their vehicles efficiency

 Goals:
  - I want to see my average spend on fuel per month/week/day
  - I want to be able to add multiple vehicles
  - I want to know my vehicles mpg
  - I want to be able to see my past records

<br>

## Design
### **Colour Scheme**
Coloured fonts were used to make the programme more visually appealing. The primary colour was used for core text, while the secondary colour was used mostly to inidicate a system message to the user.

Primary colour: Light cyan

Secondary colour: Yellow

<br>

### **Typography**
For each core screen the heading is presented in a chunky font. This has been created using [pyfiglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/0.7/) font "slant".
The font has a motorsport feel to it and so is in keeping with a tool based around vehicle performance.


<br>

### **Programme Model**

The below [Lucid](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) flowchart was created when thinking about the structure of this programme. A clear vision of the process helped to design a core model.

<br>

![Screenshot of add expenses page](documentation/readme-images/add_expenses.png)
</details>
<details>
<summary>Previous Records</summary>
The user will be shown a menu where they can select if they want to view records for fuel or expenses. They will then be taken to a new screen that displays all their previous records for that specific vehicle.

<br>

</details>
<details>
<summary>Insights</summary>
The user will be shown a menu where they can select if they want to view insights for fuel or expenses. They will then be taken to a new screen that displays these insights for that specific vehicle.

<br>

![Screenshot of a the insights menu](documentation/readme-images/insights_menu.png)

<br>

Fuel insights show averages for mpg, cost per litre, cost per month, week and day, and miles per month, week and day:

<br>

Expense insights show averages for cost per month, week and day:

### **Future Features**

There is certainly further functionality I would have liked to add to this tool given time. This includes:
 - Use of graphs via matplotlib or pandas would really enhance the visual expenerience for the user. For example it would be great to plot the change in fuel price over a period of time.
 - I would like to add the functionality to delete entries and to edit or remove vehicles attached to a persons account.

## Testing

### **Pep 8**
The Pep8 Linter shows no errors in the final code of this programme. It does however show 4 warning messages. These message all realte to my use of global variables.

From what I understood from online resources(such as [this article from Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/global-keyword) and [this article from GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/global-local-variables-python/)) you can declare a global variable outside of functions, and if you are re-assigning itâ€™s value within a function you need to use the global keyword to do this.
Linter wants me to change these variables to uppercase as it thinks they are constants but they are not constants as their value changes.
Given more time I would have liked to explore this issue further as it appears this is not the pythonic way to do this. It is something I intend to fix in the future.

### **User Story Testing**

| User Story | Solution | Tested & Successfully Completed |
| :----| :---| :----------------------:|
| I want to see my average spend on fuel per month/week/day  | Fuel insights provides averages per month, week and day | Yes |
| I want to be able to add multiple vehicles  | The first page after logging in displays any currently saved vehicles and allows the user to add up to a maximum of 3 vehicles all together | Yes |
| I want to know my vehicles mpg | Mpg is calculated automatically when a fuel entry is put through the 'Add Fuel' feature. The user must have a minimum of 3 fuel entries to view the mpg on the insights page | Yes |
| I want to be able to see my past records | The previous records options allows the user to view any previous fuel and expense entries related to a specific vehicle | Yes |

<br>

### **Bugs**
  
  | Raised by | Bug | Solution |
  | :---      | :---| :---     |
  | User tester | Username not being found when logging in straight after account creation | Moved relative variable to within the correct function so that it was being called and the correct time |
  | User tester | Average cost per litre and average cost per week and day not returning as float | Used the round() method to ensure the result of the calculation is rounded to 2 decimal places |
  | User tester | Error when trying to calculate fuel stats as not enough data | Add a requirement for the list of entries to be 3 or more otherwise prints error |
  | Pep8 Linter | Error (â€˜catching classes that do not inherit from baseexception is not allowedâ€™) when using a try/except statement to handle a ZeroDivisionError for the insights calculations | Attempted to use Exception and BaseException however these did not resolve the issue and I understand it is not best practice. Used a different piece of code to circumvent needing this but it is something I hope to investigate more thoroughly in the future |
  | Heroku deployment | Getting an error as not able to find rich.table module or dateutil module | rich and dateutil not appearing in requirements.txt file so manually added these |
